# Jetbrains Plugins Explorer

https://plugins-explorer.hsz.mobi/

This is a daily update listing of all JetBrains (IntelliJ, Android Studio, PhpStorm, WebStorm,
PyCharm, AppCode) plugins that have GitHub repository specified.

**Why just plugins with GitHub repositories?**

Using GitHub API, it is possible to fetch and parse the plugin's `plugin.xml` manifest, which
location may be different in each repository. Having the manifest file, more information is possible
to be provided for the listing and filtering, such extensions implemented by the plugin, components
or dependencies. Each implementation class can also be matched with the real repository URL,
so you can quickly access and review the source code.

This repository can be used as a good starting point for plugins development - it's always good
to check how the others have solved their problems!



*Good luck!*
